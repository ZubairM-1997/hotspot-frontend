#Hotspot 

This is my client side for my final project I had completed at Flatiron School. I have called it HotSpot. The main aim of this app was to provide a service to users which allowed them to find the Map, Weather, Trending Technology news and Local time based on a user's search of a country.

##Installing 
Before you start, the localhost server, you need to install the dependancies.
To install all dependancies, type this in the terminal

```
npm install 

```
